## Module 1: Introduction to Digital Signal Processing

### What is a signal?

Anything that conveys information can be deemed a signal in some way. It could be a sound like your alarm in the morning signaling it's time you wake up, a light such as an LED indicating your phone is charging, or even the smell of burnt cake letting you know you've left it in the oven for too long. Anything really can be a signal, but the absence of a signal can be a signal in itself. A burnt out light is a signal that you need to change the bulb, a car not in the driveway can indicate your friend is not home, or a phone call never received from the doctor could mean everything is alright (what a weird concept).

A signal does not have to be on or off, it could have other dimensions. Time is often used to convey information. A flashing light versus a steady light could mean different things, and the different patterns of the flashing could have different meanings. Space is another dimension that could convey information. A spy could covertly send a message based on which window a flag is placed in. The position of the flag could mean different things, but only the spy and its handler would know the meaning. You could as well use a different symbol for each message, such as a traffic light using green, yellow, and red lights to control traffic.

Everything and anything can be a signal, and what seems to be meaningless to you might be full of information for someone else. Use your imagination. You could devise a system to send a message that uses varying odors over time.
