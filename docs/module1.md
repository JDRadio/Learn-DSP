## Module 1: Introduction to Digital Signal Processing

### What is a signal?

Anything that conveys information can be deemed a signal in some way. It could be a sound like your alarm in the morning signaling it's time you wake up, a light such as an LED indicating your phone is charging, or even the smell of burnt cake letting you know you've left it in the oven for too long. Anything really can be a signal, but the absence of a signal can be a signal in itself. A burnt out light is a signal that you need to change the bulb, a car not in the driveway can indicate your friend is not home, or a phone call never received from the doctor could mean everything is alright (what a weird concept).

A signal does not have to be on or off, it could have other dimensions. Time is often used to convey information. A flashing light versus a steady light could mean different things, and the different patterns of the flashing could have different meanings. Space is another dimension that could convey information. A spy could covertly send a message based on which window a flag is placed in. The position of the flag could mean different things, but only the spy and its handler would know the meaning. You could as well use a different symbol for each message, such as a traffic light using green, yellow, and red lights to control traffic.

Everything and anything can be a signal, and what seems to be meaningless to you might be full of information for someone else. Use your imagination. You could devise a system to send a message that uses varying odors over time.


### Analog vs digital signals

There are 4 families of properties to a signal: analog vs digital, continuous vs discrete.

Let's start with a simplistic way to view this: analog refers to the physical world, and digital refers to using computers, also known as the digital world.

Continuous properties are infinite in nature. No matter how far you zoom in on them, there is always a value. For example, time is infinite and can be measured with infinite precision. It is continuous as you can always divide it in smaller increments.

Discrete properties, on the other hand, are limited to a specific set of possible values, with nothing in-between. For example, traffic lights have -- in the simplest case -- three lights each which are either on or off, ideally with only one light on at a time. This means there are only 3 valid states, making traffic lights a discrete system.

It is possible to have a signal with both continuous and discrete properties, but most of the time, we will consider analog signals as continuous and digital signals as discrete. Given the infinite nature of continuous signals, it would be impractical to store them in digital form.
